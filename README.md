#### [Fair Shares: Strategy-Proofness in Single Resource Allocation Mechanisms for Dynamic Demands](./CS_525.pdf)

> We implement and analyze SOTA resource allocation algorithms under dynamic real-world workloads. Previous works donâ€™t consider strategy-proofness (robustness under greedy users misrepresenting their needs), so we evaluate utilization (Pareto efficiency) and fairness (short/long-term, welfare) in workloads with greedy users.
